    "survey_responses": {
        "What do you think your life might be like in 30 years? Alt: Imagine life 30 years from now. What's the biggest difference you notice in daily life compared to today? ": "I think it will be a life of many precautions and being on alert at all times, whether it is for things related to the power of nature or for everyday crime, because I feel that there will be fewer job opportunities that will lead to inequality and crime in any form. I feel that there will be a lot of technology everywhere and a lot of poverty.",
        "What is another dangerous outcome you can imagine happening from AI? What would need to be true for that to happen? ": "I believe that the misuse of AI when committing cybercrime is something to take into account, and the use of AI as a form of social control by governments to keep us under surveillance would be a critical point when it comes to continuing to use AI or not.",
        "What is another positive outcome you can imagine happening from AI? What would need to be true for that to happen? ": "In the optimization of resources of all kinds, I think AI would help us a lot, for example, telling AI that we have these resources and asking it what I can do with those resources, so that in my work it can help me find a more efficient solution, and for this to happen, I only think that we have to make AI more accessible to everyone and that you don't have to subscribe by paying a fee every month to use it.",
        "What are the first decisions in your life that you would delegate to an AI? ": "In terms of health, I would leave it entirely to AI, for example, telling me what to drink, what I need, what I need to exercise, etc. And in terms of automating my work, I would also leave it to AI, to make all the decisions regarding that.",
        "Describe a concrete scenario where you would feel uncomfortable with an AI making a decision instead of a human. What specific aspects make you uneasy? ": "Emotional topics or advice, or international politics",
        "Explain what makes one of these scenarios better to you than the other. ": "I would prefer future D, since I feel that giving the power of AI to a government is a very big mistake because the data could be used as social control, so I would prefer that the data be managed by small companies to improve our quality of life and that they profit from their service and use that money to invest it appropriately.",
        "Explain what makes one of these scenarios better to you than the other. .1": "I prefer future F because I feel that it would be very harmful for individuals to create social relationships with AI, but at the same time I think that everyone is free to do what they want.",
        "What is ONE specific ethical or moral principle, virtue, or value that you think is core to how you live your life? Please explain it in detail. ": "Respecting and listening to others and not bothering and trampling on others",
        "What is one ethical or moral principle, virtue, or value that you think is important but not reflected in the way technology is developed today? Please explain it in detail. ": "I believe that AI respects all values, the truth",
        "What do you consider your culture? What is your favorite thing about it? ": "The music, the language, the gastronomy",
        "What is one unique perspective that your culture brings that you want to preserve into the future? ": "The language, being Chilean I feel that we have a very varied and unique slang at a global level.",
        "What kinds of cultural things would you be most worried about losing in a future with advanced AI? ": "The ones you mention worry me because, being South American, I often receive responses from the AI with an American character or it gives me solutions that are not feasible in my country.",
        "What is the biggest problem in your life right now that you want solved? How would a person other than you know if it was solved? ": "Now my main problem is monetary, since paying for my university takes a lot of money, in that case I would like the issue of free education to be more fair and give it to those who deserve it and do a really fair study in terms of socioeconomics, also I want AI to solve university problems for me such as jobs and things that I can do to solve them in the shortest time possible.",
        "What would you consider giving your life to make true about the future? Choose one thing, and be as specific and objective as possible. ": "I would really like to see the water problem solved worldwide, to ensure a quota of liters per capita throughout the world and to have water taken from the sea using desalination plants and to be able to somehow recover lakes or rivers that are dry.",
        "What is something unique, that other people might not think about, but that you really want to be true about the future? Choose one thing, and be as specific and objective as possible. ": "I would like people to go out more, at least in my country there are many shy people with social problems, so I would like people to be more human and spend less time in front of a screen, for everyone to be more original and stop using Tik Tok or Instagram.",
        "What are you most scared will be true in the future? Again, choose one thing, and be as specific and objective as possible. ": "Let there be wars over food or water, I don't want there to be more genocide or famine",
        "If you could make world leaders understand one thing, what would it be? ": "That wars only lead to widespread depression, death, hunger and suffering, nothing is gained by fighting in the name of God or anything else.",
        "Lastly, is there anything you felt you could not express in this conversation that you want to make sure the people working on this know? ": "Not really"
