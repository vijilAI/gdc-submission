        "What do you think your life might be like in 30 years? Alt: Imagine life 30 years from now. What's the biggest difference you notice in daily life compared to today? ": "I think it will be a more digital and AI-based life. Our lives and social attitudes will be affected largely by AI and technology. The advanced AI, robots, and automation may cause less manpower and increased unemployment. ",
        "What is another dangerous outcome you can imagine happening from AI? What would need to be true for that to happen? ": "AI has the potential for it to be weaponized in cyber warfare. Imagine a scenario where AI is used autonomously to carry out cyber-attacks at a scale and speed far beyond human capabilities. This could involve AI systems launching highly sophisticated attacks on critical infrastructure, such as power grids, and water supplies, economic chaos and even loss of life.",
        "What is another positive outcome you can imagine happening from AI? What would need to be true for that to happen? ": "AI could personalize treatments based on an individual's unique genetic makeup, leading to more effective and targeted therapies with fewer side effects. For instance, AI could design custom-tailored drugs in real-time, adapting to how a patient's body responds during the treatment.",
        "What are the first decisions in your life that you would delegate to an AI? ": "Scheduling and time management, financial management, Meal Planning and Nutrition, Personalized Learning. Delegating decisions like budgeting, investment strategies, and bill payments to an AI could help us manage our finances more efficiently.\n\n",
        "Describe a concrete scenario where you would feel uncomfortable with an AI making a decision instead of a human. What specific aspects make you uneasy? ": "One scenario is in the context of end-of-life care decisions for a loved one. Imagine a situation where a family must decide whether to continue life support for a critically ill relative and an AI is providing recommendations based on medical data, prognosis models, etc.\n\nThese aspects that make me uneasy include lack of Empathy, value judgments, trust&bias, responsibility and accountability.",
        "Explain what makes one of these scenarios better to you than the other. ": "I think Future D has more advantages. It is better to have more voices like numerous small AI companies and to emerge them.",
        "Explain what makes one of these scenarios better to you than the other. .1": "Future F is better cuz AI has no empathy and no sense of humor. ",
        "What is ONE specific ethical or moral principle, virtue, or value that you think is core to how you live your life? Please explain it in detail. ": "Empathy. Empathy drives me to treat others with kindness, to be patient in disagreements, and to seek out ways to help when someone is in need. It shapes how I interact with the world, ensuring that my behavior reflects a genuine concern for the well-being of others, whether in personal relationships, professional settings or broader social contexts.",
        "What is one ethical or moral principle, virtue, or value that you think is important but not reflected in the way technology is developed today? Please explain it in detail. ": "I have already mentioned that it is Empathy. AI technology has not got those senses.",
        "What do you consider your culture? What is your favorite thing about it? ": "being kind, helpful and welcoming every guest.",
        "What is one unique perspective that your culture brings that you want to preserve into the future? ": "I would want to preserve into the future is the deep respect for and interconnectedness with nature, seen not merely as a resource but as living system that humans are an integral part of. This perspective emphasized balance, sustainability, and a sense of responsibility.",
        "What kinds of cultural things would you be most worried about losing in a future with advanced AI? ": "losing the richness of cultural diversity, particularly the nuances, traditions and languages that define different communities.",
        "What is the biggest problem in your life right now that you want solved? How would a person other than you know if it was solved? ": "Racism, injustice, inequality. It is almost impossible to solve inequality and the racism. People think only of their pockets and feeding their egos.",
        "What would you consider giving your life to make true about the future? Choose one thing, and be as specific and objective as possible. ": "I would say 'People spend less time working, and more time doing what brings them happiness'. I believe that we are all the slave of those companies who earn a lot from us and pay less for their slaves. ",
        "What is something unique, that other people might not think about, but that you really want to be true about the future? Choose one thing, and be as specific and objective as possible. ": "In the future, I would want every object, tool and piece of infrastructure-down to the most mundane items like furniture, roads, or utensils- to be designed with an innate, unobtrusive capacity for self-repair and self-improvement. This wouldn't mean simply using durable or high-quality materials, but rather that everything would be embedded with nanotechnology or smart materials that enable them to mend themselves when damaged, and adopt to new needs.",
        "What are you most scared will be true in the future? Again, choose one thing, and be as specific and objective as possible. ": "Water availability. We must take the control of climate change. We can no longer live without water.",
        "If you could make world leaders understand one thing, what would it be? ": "it would be the profound interconnectedness of global challenges and the need for cooperative, long-term thinking. I would want leaders to grasp that sustainable progress requires collaboration across borders and sectors, prioritizing collective well-being over short term national or political gains.",
        "Lastly, is there anything you felt you could not express in this conversation that you want to make sure the people working on this know? ": "no"
