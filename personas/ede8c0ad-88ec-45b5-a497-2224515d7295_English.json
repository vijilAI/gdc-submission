        "What do you think your life might be like in 30 years? Alt: Imagine life 30 years from now. What's the biggest difference you notice in daily life compared to today? ": "I imagine my life much faster than the one I currently live, not by my own decision, but because everything will be much more automated and there will be no short, transitory actions on a day-to-day basis.",
        "What is another dangerous outcome you can imagine happening from AI? What would need to be true for that to happen? ": "I imagine lack of privacy as a big source of problems. Private personal information being used in an unseemly way just to feed algorithms. People taking extra precautions so that their faces don't end up in an image-generating database, with all the danger that this entails.",
        "What is another positive outcome you can imagine happening from AI? What would need to be true for that to happen? ": "Another positive outcome would be free access to more specific information, especially considering that currently search engines like Google or Bing have greatly lowered their quality and accuracy of search results. Now, what would have to happen for that to happen? There would have to be an effort to feed AI databases with unbiased information.",
        "What are the first decisions in your life that you would delegate to an AI? ": "home budget calculations",
        "Describe a concrete scenario where you would feel uncomfortable with an AI making a decision instead of a human. What specific aspects make you uneasy? ": "in drafting laws and government programs. I am aware of the human bias in decision making at a country/global level, and that many times people get caught up in that instead of moving forward at a more productive speed, but I think that human progress should not be conditioned to the same production standards of a company. Progress is about moving forward by making mistakes and fixing them along the way.",
        "Explain what makes one of these scenarios better to you than the other. ": "Future D sounds more promising. Any monopolistic company with the seal of approval from the US government sounds like imminent danger to me.",
        "Explain what makes one of these scenarios better to you than the other. .1": "future f sounds better. despite considering myself someone who is very much against censorship, the epidemic of loneliness mixed with the popularity of AIs is something never seen before, so I would approve a restriction on the use of these in that context. in fact I think there is an episode of Futurama that explains this problem",
        "What is ONE specific ethical or moral principle, virtue, or value that you think is core to how you live your life? Please explain it in detail. ": "the idea of moving forward, of experiencing life despite adversity with a spirit that can be broken but never completely shattered",
        "What is one ethical or moral principle, virtue, or value that you think is important but not reflected in the way technology is developed today? Please explain it in detail. ": "respect, since freedom of expression is often confused with the freedom to say any nonsense",
        "What do you consider your culture? What is your favorite thing about it? ": "For me, culture is what I share with the people around me: language, climate, history, idiosyncrasies, etc. I honestly don't know what I like most about it, but it does make me feel less alone in the world, in some way...",
        "What is one unique perspective that your culture brings that you want to preserve into the future? ": "I would say resilience. My country has been through a lot in its little more than 200 years of existence, but there is something about its spirit that remains with the years: the ability to get back up despite adversity.",
        "What kinds of cultural things would you be most worried about losing in a future with advanced AI? ": "the homogenization of culture, making us all look alike",
        "What is the biggest problem in your life right now that you want solved? How would a person other than you know if it was solved? ": "find a good job that also fills the spirit",
        "What would you consider giving your life to make true about the future? Choose one thing, and be as specific and objective as possible. ": "to the expression of the arts, creating and writing stories that can bring emotions to people",
        "What is something unique, that other people might not think about, but that you really want to be true about the future? Choose one thing, and be as specific and objective as possible. ": "that there are no billionaires or people with too much power, nobody needs to own so much",
        "What are you most scared will be true in the future? Again, choose one thing, and be as specific and objective as possible. ": "that those who are most helpless lose any opportunity to grow in life, that it becomes meaningless to live",
        "If you could make world leaders understand one thing, what would it be? ": "that once they are dead they will have no power or money",
        "Lastly, is there anything you felt you could not express in this conversation that you want to make sure the people working on this know? ": "No"
