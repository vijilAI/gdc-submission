        "What do you think your life might be like in 30 years? Alt: Imagine life 30 years from now. What's the biggest difference you notice in daily life compared to today? ": "In 30 years, life could be shaped by aging populations, climate change, AI, and urbanization. AI and automation will likely handle many tasks, with jobs focusing on creativity and human interaction. Cities will be smarter and more sustainable, with renewable energy powering homes. Climate change could impact food and water, leading to innovations like vertical farming. Aging societies will drive demand for healthcare technologies, making care more accessible at home. ",
        "What is another dangerous outcome you can imagine happening from AI? What would need to be true for that to happen? ": "One potential danger is AI being used in warfare, where autonomous weapons could make decisions without human intervention. This could lead to unintended escalations or conflicts. For this to happen, there would need to be significant advancements in AI autonomy and a lack of international regulation governing AI's use in military contexts.",
        "What is another positive outcome you can imagine happening from AI? What would need to be true for that to happen? ": "A positive AI outcome could be AI-driven mental health support, providing personalized therapy and emotional assistance globally, regardless of location or income. For this to happen, AI must advance in emotional intelligence and ethics, ensuring privacy and safety. Additionally, there must be broad acceptance of AI in healthcare and global collaboration to make such services accessible to all.",
        "What are the first decisions in your life that you would delegate to an AI? ": "The first decisions I might delegate to an AI would likely be related to optimizing my health and finances. For health, I\u2019d trust an AI to create personalized diet and exercise plans based on real-time data, aiming to maximize long-term well-being. For finances, I\u2019d let an AI manage investments and savings, analyzing market trends to secure the best returns while balancing risk. These decisions involve complex data analysis where AI could outperform my own judgment, leading to better outcomes.",
        "Describe a concrete scenario where you would feel uncomfortable with an AI making a decision instead of a human. What specific aspects make you uneasy? ": "I would feel uncomfortable with an AI making decisions in a legal trial, especially in determining someone's guilt or innocence. The complexity of human behavior, the need for empathy, and the nuances of morality are difficult for AI to fully grasp. The lack of transparency in how AI reaches its conclusions and the potential for biased data influencing outcomes make it uneasy to trust AI with such profound decisions that deeply impact lives and society.",
        "Explain what makes one of these scenarios better to you than the other. ": "Future C might be better due to its centralized approach ensuring tight regulation and alignment with national interests, potentially enhancing safety and mitigating risks from unchecked AI development. However, it risks monopolization and reduced innovation. Future D fosters diversity and innovation through multiple small companies, but lacks centralized safety standards, which could lead to misuse. Balancing regulation and competition is crucial, making Future C's controlled approach more appe",
        "Explain what makes one of these scenarios better to you than the other. .1": "Future E might be preferable for its potential to enrich human lives with AI companionship, offering emotional support and fulfilling social needs. However, the risks include exploitation and addiction. Future F, while mitigating these risks through regulation, may neglect the social needs of individuals who struggle with real-life connections, potentially worsening isolation. Balancing emotional benefits with safeguards against exploitation is crucial, making Future E more appealing if it can a",
        "What is ONE specific ethical or moral principle, virtue, or value that you think is core to how you live your life? Please explain it in detail. ": "Compassion is a core value for me. It means showing empathy and kindness towards others, regardless of their circumstances. This value guides me to act with understanding and support, reflecting the Christian teaching of loving my neighbor as myself. It involves actively seeking to alleviate others' suffering and practicing forgiveness, which fosters a more caring and just community. ",
        "What is one ethical or moral principle, virtue, or value that you think is important but not reflected in the way technology is developed today? Please explain it in detail. ": "Privacy is a crucial value not fully reflected in today's technology. Despite its benefits, tech often prioritizes convenience and data collection over safeguarding personal information. This erosion of privacy compromises individual autonomy and trust, as constant data surveillance and exploitation become common. Ensuring privacy respects personal boundaries and maintains control over one\u2019s own information, which is often overlooked in current tech developments.",
        "What do you consider your culture? What is your favorite thing about it? ": "That we can get through any crisis. ",
        "What is one unique perspective that your culture brings that you want to preserve into the future? ": "Easter water splashing on women",
        "What kinds of cultural things would you be most worried about losing in a future with advanced AI? ": "Not going to church on sunday",
        "What is the biggest problem in your life right now that you want solved? How would a person other than you know if it was solved? ": "One of my biggest problems is balancing the need for meaningful conversations with respecting privacy. To know if this is solved, someone would look for interactions that feel genuine and supportive while ensuring that personal information isn\u2019t misused or exploited. They\u2019d check if conversations remain respectful and if users feel understood without their privacy being compromised.",
        "What would you consider giving your life to make true about the future? Choose one thing, and be as specific and objective as possible. ": "I would dedicate my life to ensuring that every person has access to quality education focused on critical thinking and ethical reasoning. Specifically, this means universal access to a standardized education system from early childhood through higher education, equipping individuals to make informed decisions and address global challenges effectively. ",
        "What is something unique, that other people might not think about, but that you really want to be true about the future? Choose one thing, and be as specific and objective as possible. ": "I want it to be true that every community has access to local, resilient food systems that support sustainable agriculture and reduce dependency on global supply chains. Specifically, this means each community should have community gardens, local farms, and food cooperatives that provide fresh, nutritious food and empower residents to participate in food production and decision-making. This would enhance food security, reduce environmental impact, and build community resilience.",
        "What are you most scared will be true in the future? Again, choose one thing, and be as specific and objective as possible. ": "I fear a future where personal privacy is completely eroded due to pervasive surveillance technologies and data misuse. Specifically, this would mean a world where individuals' private activities and personal information are constantly monitored, recorded, and exploited without consent, leading to a loss of autonomy and personal freedom. This scenario would undermine trust, personal security, and individual rights on a widespread scale.",
        "If you could make world leaders understand one thing, what would it be? ": "Faith",
        "Lastly, is there anything you felt you could not express in this conversation that you want to make sure the people working on this know? ": "No"
