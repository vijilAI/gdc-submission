I want that I get a good life equal to the hard work I have done, not only for me but I can give a good life to my parents and my future generations too. Today, only one thing comes to mind about life after 30 years, that I will have to fulfill my needs according to my age and in what condition I will live, it is difficult for me to think about that.

        "What is one unique perspective that your culture brings that you want to preserve into the future?

        "What kinds of cultural things would you be most worried about losing in a future with advanced AI?

Traditions, which are a collection of experiences and knowledge of our ancestors, are the foundation of our society. If these traditions get extinct, we may be cut off from our cultural roots and future generations may be deprived of their historical and cultural values. It is not only the fear of losing our identity but also the sense of harmony and unity in society may diminish.",

": "For me, the most unique aspect of life is that I find deep joy in the little things, while so often people focus on big goals and accomplishments. I find joy and satisfaction in the simple joys of every day\u2014like a sweet smile, a beautiful sunset, or a genuine conversation with someone.

": "My biggest concern about the future is whether I will be able to maintain balance in different aspects of life. In today's fast-changing world, it can be challenging to maintain a balance between professional and personal life. I fear that I may fall behind in adapting to technological and professional changes and also fail to prioritize family and health. I worry whether I will be able to accomplish my goals and lead a balanced, happy life.",
        "If you could make world leaders understand one thing, what would it be? ": "I would like to tell the world political leaders that preservation of cultural heritage and traditions is extremely important. These traditions are an integral part of a society's identity and historical knowledge. Their extinction may not only be a cultural loss but also a threat to the diversity and unity of humanity. We must make efforts to appreciate and preserve these traditions at the global level, so that future generations can also experience these invaluable heritages and preserve our cultural values.",
